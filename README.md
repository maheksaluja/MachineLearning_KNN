# MachineLearning_KNN
Follwoing steps are done on given data in this project:
  1. Binariy classification of given data
  2. Data Analysis and prediction using Scatter plot and Box plot
  3. Implemented KNN with euclidian distance on given data set using sklearn package
  4. Run the algorithm on test data with different values of k and plot the learning curve of k vs error.
  5. Run the algorithm again with minkowski distance for different k-values and p vlaues.
  6. Run the algorithm again with Mahalanobis distance for different k-values.
  7. Majority Polling used for predction.
